"""
fp_check.py:
Functions for comparing floating-point values, using a tolerance (default value 0.0001) to
define euqality.  (e.g. x==y if abs(x - y) < tolerance0.

For each function there is a vectorized version, which applies the function to each element 
of a matric, returning a matric of the results.  (Having learned more of NumPy since writing this,
its not clear to me these are necessary -- seems to be automatic.)
